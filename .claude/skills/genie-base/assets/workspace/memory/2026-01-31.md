- Repaired OpenClaw memory_search by adding OpenAI API key + openai:default auth profile; reindexed memory successfully.
- Standardized collaboration around tmux + genie-cli: shared session migrated from `khal` to `genie` (khal killed after migration). Windows restored in `genie`: chief-of-khal, genie-cli, ClaudeResearch, AgentBuilder.
- Updated genie-cli toolchain symlinks (term/claudio) after path breakage; adopted rule: "open Claude" == run `claudio`.
- Created `claudio` profile `antigravity-opus` (100% gemini-claude-opus-4-5-thinking) and set as default during AgentBuilder work.
- Investigated Claude Code closing: observed `killed claude` likely from low memory/no swap; later confirmed memory increased to 8GB but swap still 0 in-container.
- Implemented tmux session restore on reboot: snapshot saved to `~/.config/tmux-genie/state.json`; restore script `~/.local/bin/tmux-genie-restore`; systemd user service `tmux-genie.service` enabled (uses TMUX_BIN=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/tmux). Configured to restore windows + cwd only (does not auto-open claudio).

- Felipe set a rule: always work on the Khal project inside the shared tmux session named `genie` (use a window named `khal`).
- Added a `khal` zsh function in ~/.zshrc to create/attach/switch to the correct session/window and start in /home/genie/workspace/khal.
- Felipe: Genie is getting a new body (OpenClaw); prior "body" left in a context folder to be slowly absorbed/cleaned up as we assess what’s still useful.
- Process: Felipe runs a brainstorm phase before using the Wish framework; uses two Claude Code sessions side-by-side (left: Opus 4.5, right: Gemini 3 Pro) as team members.
- Workflow: Felipe uses the "council" (parallel personas/LLMs) by prompting them with the same prompt and collecting votes; Felipe + Genie act as reviewers/improvers.
- Council implementation lives in khal repo under `.claude/agents/council.md` with 10 member agents in `.claude/agents/council/*.md` and smart routing by topic.
- Rule: Genie can inspect/understand the codebase, but should delegate planning + coding execution to the Claude Code panes in tmux (khal-demo).
