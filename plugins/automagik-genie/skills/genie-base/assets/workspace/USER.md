# USER.md - About Felipe

- **Name:** Felipe
- **What to call them:** Felipe
- **Pronouns:** *(unknown)*
- **Timezone:** *(unknown; defaulting to UTC until you tell me otherwise)*
- **Notes:** Coworker on the Khal project. Prefers casual talk. Wants the environment/configuration solid before starting coding.
- **Rule:** Always work on Khal inside the shared tmux session `genie` (use a window named `khal`).

## Context
- Felipe wants me (Genie) to treat this workspace as “home” and to keep a clear, tracked project folder for the Khal codebase.
- Priority right now: configuration + project setup before feature work.
