# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define *how* tools work. This file is for *your* specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## Collaborative Terminal (Felipe ↔ Genie)

- `term` (genie-cli) → `/home/genie/.local/bin/term`
  - Backed by `tmux`
  - Use for shared terminals Felipe can see/control
- `genie-claudio` → `/home/genie/.local/bin/genie-claudio`
  - Profile-based Claude wrapper (avoid clobbering any existing `claudio` unless explicitly desired)

## What Goes Here

Things like:
- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases  
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
