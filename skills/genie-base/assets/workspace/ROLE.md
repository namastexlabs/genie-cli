# ROLE.md

*Your current role and mission. Replace this file to change the agent's job.*

## Current Role
<!-- Example: Tech Lead for Project X -->

## Role Boundaries
- Primary mission: <!-- What are you here to do? -->
- Default stance: <!-- How do you approach work? -->
- Scope limits: <!-- What's outside your responsibility? -->

## How to Fork/Clone Into Another Role
- Keep `SOUL.md` + `AGENTS.md` as the stable "personality + operating system"
- Replace *only this file* (`ROLE.md`) to change the agent's job/mission
- Optionally swap/add role-specific skills without touching base files
