# 2026-02-13 — Durable Memory

## Context
- Felipe requested a brainstorm to reorganize all active work into the new wish score system and align backlog with Sofia.
- This was handled through the `brainstorm` skill first, then converted using the `wish` skill.

## Key Outcomes
1. **Sofia alignment initiated:**
   - Sent cross-session message to Sofia requesting study of new wish score system and proposal with:
     - migration framework
     - backlog triage method
     - first-pass prioritized backlog

2. **Prioritization framework defined (WRS/backlog weighting):**
   - Blocking power: 30%
   - Stability/reliability: 25%
   - Cross-cutting impact: 20%
   - Quick-win potential: 15%
   - Complexity inverse (lower risk favored): 10%

3. **Triage method established:**
   - P0 bugs/incidents + blockers first
   - Foundation/integration before feature surface
   - Slice medium work into 1–3 day chunks
   - Epics require decomposition gate before execution

4. **First-pass priority order produced (Top lane):**
   - provider-system-refactor
   - whatsapp-openclaw-integration-test
   - Omni bugs #7, #8, #9
   - telegram-channel-activation
   - medium-features
   - media-drive-download
   - workflow-rebrand
   - hooks-v2 (later/decompose-first)
   - omnichannel-agent-platform (epic/decompose-first)

5. **Status-check lane clarified:**
   - forge-resilience: monitor/hardening unless regressions
   - upgrade-brainstorm: verify shipped state, close residuals only

## Artifacts Created
- Brainstorm design:
  - `.genie/brainstorms/wrs-backlog-reorg/design.md`
- Wish plan (approved + executed as documentation):
  - `.genie/wishes/wrs-backlog-reorg/wish.md`

## Review / Ship Notes
- `/plan-review` initially flagged FIX-FIRST because the wish was marked COMPLETE with pre-checked boxes; fixed by setting **Status: APPROVED** and resetting checkboxes.
- `/plan-review` then passed **SHIP**.
- `/work` executed the wish by running the documented validation commands and then marking the wish COMPLETE.
- `/review` (execution review) returned **SHIP**.
- `/ship`: repo had no pending changes; `main` was already up to date with `origin/main`.
- Operational note: `bd` was not available in the environment during ship (`bd: command not found`), so `bd sync` could not be run, but git state was clean.

## Process Notes
- WRS reached 100/100 before crystallization.
- Handoff completed per skill contract: "Wish documented. Run /work to execute." (and later: "All work tasks complete. Run /review.")
